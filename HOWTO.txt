Steps for the session:

1. Sign up for WaxLRS at http://waxlrs.com. You're going to need to choose a
site name (which is unique to you) and put in your name, email, and password.

The site name you put in is going to be the first part of your WaxLRS URL,
such as mystrangesitename.waxlrs.com. We're going to use it later.

When you sign up, you'll be redirected to a login form. Log in there with the
email and password you gave when you signed up.

Click on the gear in the upper right corner, which will take you to settings.
Down near the bottom of the page, click the "Create New Basic" button.

Keep this page open, we're going to use some info on it later. But first,
time to open a new browser window or tab.

Navigate to Twilio and sign up (you'll need to verify your phone number by
receiving an SMS). Then head to the configuration page for the free number
Twilio gives you. That's where we're going to use the information from WaxLRS.

In the SMS Request URL Box, set the URL to
http://mlearnconsms.appspot.com/<yoursitename>/<basiccredentiallogin>/<basiccredentialpassword>
- no slash on the end, and POST selected to the right.

That's it! Send an SMS to the number and shortly you should get a response.
While you're on a free Twilio account your SMSs will have prefixes on them.
